  78: 
  79: 	PROLOGUE
  80: 
  81: 
  82: 	Two households, both alike in dignity,
  83: 	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
  84: 	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
  85: 	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
  86: 	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  87: 	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
  88: 	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
  89: 	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
  90: 	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
  91: 	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
  92: 	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
  93: 	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
  94: 	The which if you with patient ears attend,
  95: 	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

 103: ACT I
 104: 
 105: 
 106: 
 107: SCENE I	Verona. A public place.
 108: 
 109: 
 110: 	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
 111: 	armed with swords and bucklers]
 112: 
 113: SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
 114: 
 115: GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.
 116: 
 117: SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
 118: 
 119: GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
 120: 
 121: SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.
 122: 
 123: GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
 124: 
 125: SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
 126: 
 127: GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
 128: 	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
 129: 
 130: SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
 131: 	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
 132: 
 133: GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
 134: 	to the wall.
 135: 
 136: SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
 137: 	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
 138: 	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
 139: 	to the wall.
 140: 
 141: GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
 142: 
 143: SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
 144: 	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
 145: 	maids, and cut off their heads.
 146: 
 147: GREGORY	The heads of the maids?
 148: 
 149: SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
 150: 	take it in what sense thou wilt.
 151: 
 152: GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.
 153: 
 154: SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
 155: 	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
 156: 
 157: GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
 158: 	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
 159: 	two of the house of the Montagues.
 160: 
 161: SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
 162: 
 163: GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?
 164: 
 165: SAMPSON	Fear me not.
 166: 
 167: GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!
 168: 
 169: SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
 170: 
 171: GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
 172: 	they list.
 173: 
 174: SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
 175: 	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
 176: 
 177: 	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
 178: 
 179: ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
 180: 
 181: SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.
 182: 
 183: ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
 184: 
 185: SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
 186: 	ay?
 187: 
 188: GREGORY	No.
 189: 
 190: SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
 191: 	bite my thumb, sir.
 192: 
 193: GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?
 194: 
 195: ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.
 196: 
 197: SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
 198: 
 199: ABRAHAM	No better.
 200: 
 201: SAMPSON	Well, sir.
 202: 
 203: GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
 204: 
 205: SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.
 206: 
 207: ABRAHAM	You lie.
 208: 
 209: SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
 210: 
 211: 	[They fight]
 212: 
 213: 	[Enter BENVOLIO]
 214: 
 215: BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
 216: 	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
 217: 
 218: 	[Beats down their swords]
 219: 
 220: 	[Enter TYBALT]
 221: 
 222: TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
 223: 	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
 224: 
 225: BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
 226: 	Or manage it to part these men with me.
 227: 
 228: TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
 229: 	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
 230: 	Have at thee, coward!
 231: 
 232: 	[They fight]
 233: 
 234: 	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
 235: 	then enter Citizens, with clubs]
 236: 
 237: First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
 238: 	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
 239: 
 240: 	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
 241: 
 242: CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
 243: 
 244: LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
 245: 
 246: CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
 247: 	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
 248: 
 249: 	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
 250: 
 251: MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
 252: 
 253: LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
 254: 
 255: 	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
 256: 
 257: PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
 258: 	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
 259: 	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
 260: 	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
 261: 	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
 262: 	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
 263: 	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
 264: 	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
 265: 	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
 266: 	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
 267: 	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
 268: 	And made Verona's ancient citizens
 269: 	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
 270: 	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
 271: 	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
 272: 	If ever you disturb our streets again,
 273: 	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
 274: 	For this time, all the rest depart away:
 275: 	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
 276: 	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
 277: 	To know our further pleasure in this case,
 278: 	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
 279: 	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
 280: 
 281: 	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
 282: 
 283: MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
 284: 	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
 285: 
 286: BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
 287: 	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
 288: 	I drew to part them: in the instant came
 289: 	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
 290: 	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
 291: 	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
 292: 	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
 293: 	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
 294: 	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
 295: 	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
 296: 
 297: LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
 298: 	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
 299: 
 300: BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
 301: 	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
 302: 	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
 303: 	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
 304: 	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
 305: 	So early walking did I see your son:
 306: 	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
 307: 	And stole into the covert of the wood:
 308: 	I, measuring his affections by my own,
 309: 	That most are busied when they're most alone,
 310: 	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
 311: 	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
 312: 
 313: MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
 314: 	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
 315: 	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
 316: 	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
 317: 	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
 318: 	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
 319: 	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
 320: 	And private in his chamber pens himself,
 321: 	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
 322: 	And makes himself an artificial night:
 323: 	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
 324: 	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
 325: 
 326: BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
 327: 
 328: MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
 329: 
 330: BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?
 331: 
 332: MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
 333: 	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
 334: 	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
 335: 	But to himself so secret and so close,
 336: 	So far from sounding and discovery,
 337: 	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
 338: 	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
 339: 	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
 340: 	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
 341: 	We would as willingly give cure as know.
 342: 
 343: 	[Enter ROMEO]
 344: 
 345: BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
 346: 	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
 347: 
 348: MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
 349: 	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
 350: 
 351: 	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
 352: 
 353: BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.
 354: 
 355: ROMEO	Is the day so young?
 356: 
 357: BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
 358: 
 359: ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
 360: 	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
 361: 
 362: BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
 363: 
 364: ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
 365: 
 366: BENVOLIO	In love?
 367: 
 368: ROMEO	Out--
 369: 
 370: BENVOLIO	Of love?
 371: 
 372: ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
 373: 
 374: BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
 375: 	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
 376: 
 377: ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
 378: 	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
 379: 	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
 380: 	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
 381: 	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
 382: 	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
 383: 	O any thing, of nothing first create!
 384: 	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
 385: 	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
 386: 	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
 387: 	sick health!
 388: 	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
 389: 	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
 390: 	Dost thou not laugh?
 391: 
 392: BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
 393: 
 394: ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
 395: 
 396: BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
 397: 
 398: ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
 399: 	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
 400: 	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
 401: 	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
 402: 	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
 403: 	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
 404: 	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
 405: 	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
 406: 	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
 407: 	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
 408: 	Farewell, my coz.
 409: 
 410: BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
 411: 	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
 412: 
 413: ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
 414: 	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
 415: 
 416: BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
 417: 
 418: ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
 419: 
 420: BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
 421: 	But sadly tell me who.
 422: 
 423: ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
 424: 	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
 425: 	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
 426: 
 427: BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
 428: 
 429: ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
 430: 
 431: BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
 432: 
 433: ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
 434: 	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
 435: 	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
 436: 	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
 437: 	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
 438: 	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
 439: 	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
 440: 	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
 441: 	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
 442: 
 443: BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
 444: 
 445: ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
 446: 	For beauty starved with her severity
 447: 	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
 448: 	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
 449: 	To merit bliss by making me despair:
 450: 	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
 451: 	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
 452: 
 453: BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
 454: 
 455: ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.
 456: 
 457: BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
 458: 	Examine other beauties.
 459: 
 460: ROMEO	'Tis the way
 461: 	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
 462: 	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
 463: 	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
 464: 	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
 465: 	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
 466: 	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
 467: 	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
 468: 	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
 469: 	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
 470: 
 471: BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

 486: 
 487: 
 488: 	[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]
 489: 
 490: CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
 491: 	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
 492: 	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
 493: 
 494: PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
 495: 	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
 496: 	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
 497: 
 498: CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
 499: 	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
 500: 	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
 501: 	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
 502: 	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
 503: 
 504: PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
 505: 
 506: CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
 507: 	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
 508: 	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
 509: 	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
 510: 	My will to her consent is but a part;
 511: 	An she agree, within her scope of choice
 512: 	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
 513: 	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
 514: 	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
 515: 	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
 516: 	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
 517: 	At my poor house look to behold this night
 518: 	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
 519: 	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
 520: 	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
 521: 	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
 522: 	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
 523: 	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
 524: 	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
 525: 	Which on more view, of many mine being one
 526: 	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
 527: 	Come, go with me.
 528: 
 529: 	[To Servant, giving a paper]
 530: 
 531: 	Go, sirrah, trudge about
 532: 	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
 533: 	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
 534: 	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
 535: 
 536: 	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]
 537: 
 538: Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
 539: 	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
 540: 	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
 541: 	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
 542: 	sent to find those persons whose names are here
 543: 	writ, and can never find what names the writing
 544: 	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
 545: 
 546: 	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]
 547: 
 548: BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
 549: 	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
 550: 	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
 551: 	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
 552: 	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
 553: 	And the rank poison of the old will die.
 554: 
 555: ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
 556: 
 557: BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?
 558: 
 559: ROMEO	For your broken shin.
 560: 
 561: BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
 562: 
 563: ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
 564: 	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
 565: 	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
 566: 
 567: Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
 568: 
 569: ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
 570: 
 571: Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
 572: 	pray, can you read any thing you see?
 573: 
 574: ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
 575: 
 576: Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
 577: 
 578: ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.
 579: 
 580: 	[Reads]
 581: 
 582: 	'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
 583: 	County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
 584: 	widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
 585: 	nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
 586: 	uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
 587: 	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
 588: 	Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
 589: 	assembly: whither should they come?
 590: 
 591: Servant	Up.
 592: 
 593: ROMEO	Whither?
 594: 
 595: Servant	To supper; to our house.
 596: 
 597: ROMEO	Whose house?
 598: 
 599: Servant	My master's.
 600: 
 601: ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
 602: 
 603: Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
 604: 	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
 605: 	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
 606: 	Rest you merry!
 607: 
 608: 	[Exit]

 610: BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
 611: 	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
 612: 	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
 613: 	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
 614: 	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
 615: 	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
 616: 
 617: ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
 618: 	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
 619: 	And these, who often drown'd could never die,
 620: 	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
 621: 	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
 622: 	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
 623: 
 624: BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
 625: 	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
 626: 	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
 627: 	Your lady's love against some other maid
 628: 	That I will show you shining at this feast,
 629: 	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
 630: 
 631: ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
 632: 	But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

 651: LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
 652: 
 653: Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
 654: 	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
 655: 	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
 656: 
 657: 	[Enter JULIET]
 658: 
 659: JULIET	How now! who calls?
 660: 
 661: Nurse	Your mother.
 662: 
 663: JULIET	Madam, I am here.
 664: 	What is your will?
 665: 
 666: LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
 667: 	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
 668: 	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
 669: 	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
 670: 
 671: Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
 672: 
 673: LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.
 674: 
 675: Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
 676: 	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
 677: 	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
 678: 	To Lammas-tide?
 679: 
 680: LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.
 681: 
 682: Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
 683: 	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
 684: 	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
 685: 	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
 686: 	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
 687: 	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
 688: 	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
 689: 	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
 690: 	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
 691: 	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
 692: 	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
 693: 	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
 694: 	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
 695: 	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
 696: 	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
 697: 	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
 698: 	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
 699: 	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
 700: 	To bid me trudge:
 701: 	And since that time it is eleven years;
 702: 	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
 703: 	She could have run and waddled all about;
 704: 	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
 705: 	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
 706: 	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
 707: 	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
 708: 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
 709: 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
 710: 	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
 711: 	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
 712: 	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
 713: 	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
 714: 	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
 715: 
 716: LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
 717: 
 718: Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
 719: 	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
 720: 	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
 721: 	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
 722: 	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
 723: 	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
 724: 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
 725: 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
 726: 
 727: JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
 728: 
 729: Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
 730: 	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
 731: 	An I might live to see thee married once,
 732: 	I have my wish.
 733: 
 734: LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
 735: 	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
 736: 	How stands your disposition to be married?
 737: 
 738: JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
 739: 
 740: Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
 741: 	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
 742: 
 743: LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
 744: 	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
 745: 	Are made already mothers: by my count,
 746: 	I was your mother much upon these years
 747: 	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
 748: 	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
 749: 
 750: Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
 751: 	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
 752: 
 753: LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
 754: 
 755: Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
 756: 
 757: LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
 758: 	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
 759: 	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
 760: 	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
 761: 	Examine every married lineament,
 762: 	And see how one another lends content
 763: 	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
 764: 	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
 765: 	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
 766: 	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
 767: 	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
 768: 	For fair without the fair within to hide:
 769: 	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
 770: 	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
 771: 	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
 772: 	By having him, making yourself no less.
 773: 
 774: Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
 775: 
 776: LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
 777: 
 778: JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
 779: 	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
 780: 	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
 781: 
 782: 	[Enter a Servant]
 783: 
 784: Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
 785: 	called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
 786: 	the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
 787: 	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
 788: 
 789: LADY CAPULET	We follow thee.

 810: 
 811: 
 812: 	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
 813: 	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]
 814: 
 815: ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
 816: 	Or shall we on without a apology?
 817: 
 818: BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
 819: 	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
 820: 	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
 821: 	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
 822: 	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
 823: 	After the prompter, for our entrance:
 824: 	But let them measure us by what they will;
 825: 	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
 826: 
 827: ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
 828: 	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
 829: 
 830: MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
 831: 
 832: ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
 833: 	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
 834: 	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
 835: 
 836: MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
 837: 	And soar with them above a common bound.
 838: 
 839: ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
 840: 	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
 841: 	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
 842: 	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
 843: 
 844: MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
 845: 	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
 846: 
 847: ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
 848: 	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
 849: 
 850: MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
 851: 	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
 852: 	Give me a case to put my visage in:
 853: 	A visor for a visor! what care I
 854: 	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
 855: 	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
 856: 
 857: BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
 858: 	But every man betake him to his legs.
 859: 
 860: ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
 861: 	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
 862: 	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
 863: 	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
 864: 	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
 865: 
 866: MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
 867: 	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
 868: 	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
 869: 	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
 870: 
 871: ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.
 872: 
 873: MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
 874: 	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
 875: 	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
 876: 	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
 877: 
 878: ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
 879: 	But 'tis no wit to go.
 880: 
 881: MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?
 882: 
 883: ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.
 884: 
 885: MERCUTIO	And so did I.
 886: 
 887: ROMEO	Well, what was yours?
 888: 
 889: MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
 890: 
 891: ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
 892: 
 893: MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
 894: 	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
 895: 	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
 896: 	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
 897: 	Drawn with a team of little atomies
 898: 	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
 899: 	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
 900: 	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
 901: 	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
 902: 	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
 903: 	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
 904: 	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
 905: 	Not so big as a round little worm
 906: 	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
 907: 	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
 908: 	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
 909: 	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
 910: 	And in this state she gallops night by night
 911: 	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
 912: 	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
 913: 	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
 914: 	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
 915: 	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
 916: 	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
 917: 	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
 918: 	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
 919: 	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
 920: 	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
 921: 	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
 922: 	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
 923: 	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
 924: 	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
 925: 	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
 926: 	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
 927: 	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
 928: 	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
 929: 	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
 930: 	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
 931: 	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
 932: 	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
 933: 	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
 934: 	Making them women of good carriage:
 935: 	This is she--
 936: 
 937: ROMEO	                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
 938: 	Thou talk'st of nothing.
 939: 
 940: MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
 941: 	Which are the children of an idle brain,
 942: 	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
 943: 	Which is as thin of substance as the air
 944: 	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
 945: 	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
 946: 	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
 947: 	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
 948: 
 949: BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
 950: 	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
 951: 
 952: ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
 953: 	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 954: 	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 955: 	With this night's revels and expire the term
 956: 	Of a despised life closed in my breast
 957: 	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
 958: 	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
 959: 	Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
 960:

1006: 	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,

1028: 	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
1029: 	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
1030: 	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
1031: 
1032: Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
1033: 	His son is thirty.
1034: 
1035: CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?
1036: 	His son was but a ward two years ago.
1037: 
1038: ROMEO	[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth
1039: 	enrich the hand
1040: 	Of yonder knight?
1041: 
1042: Servant	I know not, sir.
1043: 
1044: ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1045: 	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1046: 	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
1047: 	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1048: 	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
1049: 	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1050: 	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
1051: 	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1052: 	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
1053: 	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
1054: 
1055: TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
1056: 	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
1057: 	Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
1058: 	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1059: 	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
1060: 	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
1061: 
1062: CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
1063: 
1064: TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1065: 	A villain that is hither come in spite,
1066: 	To scorn at our solemnity this night.
1067: 
1068: CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?
1069: 
1070: TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
1071: 
1072: CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
1073: 	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1074: 	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1075: 	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
1076: 	I would not for the wealth of all the town
1077: 	Here in my house do him disparagement:
1078: 	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
1079: 	It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1080: 	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1081: 	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1082: 
1083: TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
1084: 	I'll not endure him.
1085: 
1086: CAPULET	He shall be endured:
1087: 	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
1088: 	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
1089: 	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
1090: 	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1091: 	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
1092: 
1093: TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1094: 
1095: CAPULET	Go to, go to;
1096: 	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
1097: 	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
1098: 	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
1099: 	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
1100: 	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
1101: 	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
1102: 
1103: TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1104: 	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1105: 	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
1106: 	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
1107: 
1108: 	[Exit]
1109: 
1110: ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1111: 	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
1112: 	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1113: 	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1114: 
1115: JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1116: 	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1117: 	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1118: 	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1119: 
1120: ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1121: 
1122: JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1123: 
1124: ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1125: 	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1126: 
1127: JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1128: 
1129: ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
1130: 	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
1131: 
1132: JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1133: 
1134: ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1135: 	Give me my sin again.
1136: 
1137: JULIET	You kiss by the book.
1138: 
1139: Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1140: 
1141: ROMEO	What is her mother?
1142: 
1143: Nurse	Marry, bachelor,
1144: 	Her mother is the lady of the house,
1145: 	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
1146: 	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
1147: 	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1148: 	Shall have the chinks.
1149: 
1150: ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
1151: 	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1152: 
1153: BENVOLIO	Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
1154: 
1155: ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1156: 
1157: CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1158: 	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1159: 	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1160: 	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1161: 	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1162: 	Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1163: 	I'll to my rest.
1164: 
1165: 	[Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]
1166: 
1167: JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1168: 
1169: Nurse	The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1170: 
1171: JULIET	What's he that now is going out of door?
1172: 
1173: Nurse	Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
1174: 
1175: JULIET	What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1176: 
1177: Nurse	I know not.
1178: 
1179: JULIET	Go ask his name: if he be married.
1180: 	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1181: 
1182: Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1183: 	The only son of your great enemy.
1184: 
1185: JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
1186: 	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1187: 	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1188: 	That I must love a loathed enemy.
1189: 
1190: Nurse	What's this? what's this?
1191: 
1192: JULIET	A rhyme I learn'd even now
1193: 	Of one I danced withal.
1194: 
1195: 	[One calls within 'Juliet.']
1196: 
1197: Nurse	Anon, anon!
1198: 	Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1211: 	PROLOGUE
1212: 
1213: 
1214: 	[Enter Chorus]
1215: 
1216: Chorus	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1217: 	And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1218: 	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1219: 	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1220: 	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1221: 	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1222: 	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1223: 	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1224: 	Being held a foe, he may not have access
1225: 	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1226: 	And she as much in love, her means much less
1227: 	To meet her new-beloved any where:
1228: 	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1229: 	Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

1239: ACT II
1240: 
1241: 
1242: 
1243: SCENE I	A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1244: 
1245: 
1246: 	[Enter ROMEO]
1247: 
1248: ROMEO	Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1249: 	Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1250: 
1251: 	[He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it]
1252: 
1253: 	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
1254: 
1255: BENVOLIO	Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1256: 
1257: MERCUTIO	He is wise;
1258: 	And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1259: 
1260: BENVOLIO	He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1261: 	Call, good Mercutio.
1262: 
1263: MERCUTIO	Nay, I'll conjure too.
1264: 	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1265: 	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1266: 	Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1267: 	Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1268: 	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1269: 	One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1270: 	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1271: 	When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1272: 	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1273: 	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1274: 	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1275: 	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1276: 	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1277: 	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1278: 	That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1279: 
1280: BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1281: 
1282: MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1283: 	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1284: 	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1285: 	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1286: 	That were some spite: my invocation
1287: 	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
1288: 	I conjure only but to raise up him.
1289: 
1290: BENVOLIO	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1291: 	To be consorted with the humorous night:
1292: 	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1293: 
1294: MERCUTIO	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1295: 	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1296: 	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1297: 	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1298: 	Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1299: 	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1300: 	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1301: 	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1302: 	Come, shall we go?
1303: 
1304: BENVOLIO	                  Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1305: 	To seek him here that means not to be found.

1320: 
1321: 
1322: 	[Enter ROMEO]
1323: 
1324: ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1325: 
1326: 	[JULIET appears above at a window]
1327: 
1328: 	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1329: 	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1330: 	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1331: 	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1332: 	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1333: 	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1334: 	Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1335: 	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1336: 	It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1337: 	O, that she knew she were!
1338: 	She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1339: 	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1340: 	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1341: 	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1342: 	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1343: 	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1344: 	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1345: 	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1346: 	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1347: 	Would through the airy region stream so bright
1348: 	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1349: 	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1350: 	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1351: 	That I might touch that cheek!
1352: 
1353: JULIET	Ay me!
1354: 
1355: ROMEO	She speaks:
1356: 	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1357: 	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1358: 	As is a winged messenger of heaven
1359: 	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1360: 	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1361: 	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1362: 	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1363: 
1364: JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1365: 	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1366: 	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1367: 	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1368: 
1369: ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1370: 
1371: JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1372: 	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1373: 	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1374: 	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1375: 	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1376: 	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1377: 	By any other name would smell as sweet;
1378: 	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1379: 	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1380: 	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1381: 	And for that name which is no part of thee
1382: 	Take all myself.
1383: 
1384: ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:
1385: 	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1386: 	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1387: 
1388: JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1389: 	So stumblest on my counsel?
1390: 
1391: ROMEO	By a name
1392: 	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1393: 	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1394: 	Because it is an enemy to thee;
1395: 	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1396: 
1397: JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1398: 	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1399: 	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1400: 
1401: ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1402: 
1403: JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1404: 	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1405: 	And the place death, considering who thou art,
1406: 	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1407: 
1408: ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1409: 	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1410: 	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1411: 	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1412: 
1413: JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1414: 
1415: ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1416: 	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1417: 	And I am proof against their enmity.
1418: 
1419: JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1420: 
1421: ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1422: 	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1423: 	My life were better ended by their hate,
1424: 	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1425: 
1426: JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1427: 
1428: ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1429: 	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1430: 	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1431: 	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1432: 	I would adventure for such merchandise.
1433: 
1434: JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1435: 	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1436: 	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1437: 	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1438: 	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1439: 	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1440: 	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1441: 	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1442: 	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1443: 	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1444: 	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1445: 	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1446: 	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1447: 	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1448: 	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1449: 	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1450: 	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1451: 	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1452: 	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1453: 	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1454: 	And not impute this yielding to light love,
1455: 	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1456: 
1457: ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1458: 	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1459: 
1460: JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1461: 	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1462: 	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1463: 
1464: ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
1465: 
1466: JULIET	Do not swear at all;
1467: 	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1468: 	Which is the god of my idolatry,
1469: 	And I'll believe thee.
1470: 
1471: ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
1472: 
1473: JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1474: 	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1475: 	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1476: 	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1477: 	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1478: 	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1479: 	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1480: 	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1481: 	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1482: 
1483: ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1484: 
1485: JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1486: 
1487: ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1488: 
1489: JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1490: 	And yet I would it were to give again.
1491: 
1492: ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1493: 
1494: JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1495: 	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1496: 	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1497: 	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1498: 	The more I have, for both are infinite.
1499: 
1500: 	[Nurse calls within]
1501: 
1502: 	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1503: 	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1504: 	Stay but a little, I will come again.
1505: 
1506: 	[Exit, above]
1507: 
1508: ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1509: 	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1510: 	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1511: 
1512: 	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
1513: 
1514: JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1515: 	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1516: 	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1517: 	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1518: 	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1519: 	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1520: 	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1521: 
1522: Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
1523: 
1524: JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1525: 	I do beseech thee--
1526: 
1527: Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
1528: 
1529: JULIET	By and by, I come:--
1530: 	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1531: 	To-morrow will I send.
1532: 
1533: ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
1534: 
1535: JULIET	A thousand times good night!
1536: 
1537: 	[Exit, above]
1538: 
1539: ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1540: 	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1541: 	their books,
1542: 	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1543: 
1544: 	[Retiring]
1545: 
1546: 	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
1547: 
1548: JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1549: 	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1550: 	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1551: 	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1552: 	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1553: 	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1554: 
1555: ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1556: 	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1557: 	Like softest music to attending ears!
1558: 
1559: JULIET	Romeo!
1560: 
1561: ROMEO	     My dear?
1562: 
1563: JULIET	                  At what o'clock to-morrow
1564: 	Shall I send to thee?
1565: 
1566: ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
1567: 
1568: JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1569: 	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1570: 
1571: ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1572: 
1573: JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1574: 	Remembering how I love thy company.
1575: 
1576: ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1577: 	Forgetting any other home but this.
1578: 
1579: JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1580: 	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1581: 	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1582: 	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1583: 	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1584: 	So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1585: 
1586: ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.
1587: 
1588: JULIET	Sweet, so would I:
1589: 	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1590: 	Good night, good night! parting is such
1591: 	sweet sorrow,
1592: 	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1593: 
1594: 	[Exit above]
1595: 
1596: ROMEO	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1597: 	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1598: 	Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1599: 	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

1609: ACT II
1610: 
1611: 
1612: 
1613: SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.
1614: 
1615: 
1616: 	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]
1617: 
1618: FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1619: 	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1620: 	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1621: 	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1622: 	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1623: 	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1624: 	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1625: 	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1626: 	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1627: 	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1628: 	And from her womb children of divers kind
1629: 	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1630: 	Many for many virtues excellent,
1631: 	None but for some and yet all different.
1632: 	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1633: 	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1634: 	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1635: 	But to the earth some special good doth give,
1636: 	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1637: 	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1638: 	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1639: 	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1640: 	Within the infant rind of this small flower
1641: 	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1642: 	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1643: 	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1644: 	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1645: 	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1646: 	And where the worser is predominant,
1647: 	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1648: 
1649: 	[Enter ROMEO]
1650: 
1651: ROMEO	Good morrow, father.
1652: 
1653: FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
1654: 	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1655: 	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1656: 	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1657: 	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1658: 	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1659: 	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1660: 	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1661: 	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1662: 	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1663: 	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1664: 	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1665: 
1666: ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1667: 
1668: FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1669: 
1670: ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1671: 	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1672: 
1673: FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1674: 
1675: ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1676: 	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1677: 	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1678: 	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1679: 	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1680: 	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1681: 	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1682: 
1683: FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1684: 	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1685: 
1686: ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1687: 	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1688: 	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1689: 	And all combined, save what thou must combine
1690: 	By holy marriage: when and where and how
1691: 	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1692: 	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1693: 	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1694: 
1695: FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1696: 	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1697: 	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1698: 	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1699: 	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1700: 	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1701: 	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1702: 	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1703: 	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1704: 	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1705: 	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1706: 	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1707: 	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1708: 	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1709: 	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1710: 	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1711: 
1712: ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1713: 
1714: FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1715: 
1716: ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.
1717: 
1718: FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
1719: 	To lay one in, another out to have.
1720: 
1721: ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1722: 	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1723: 	The other did not so.
1724: 
1725: FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
1726: 	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1727: 	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1728: 	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1729: 	For this alliance may so happy prove,
1730: 	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1731: 
1732: ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1733: 
1734: FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

1747: 
1748: SCENE IV	A street.
1749: 
1750: 
1751: 	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
1752: 
1753: MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1754: 	Came he not home to-night?
1755: 
1756: BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1757: 
1758: MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1759: 	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1760: 
1761: BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1762: 	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1763: 
1764: MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.
1765: 
1766: BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.
1767: 
1768: MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1769: 
1770: BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1771: 	dares, being dared.
1772: 
1773: MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1774: 	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1775: 	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1776: 	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1777: 	encounter Tybalt?
1778: 
1779: BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?
1780: 
1781: MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1782: 	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1783: 	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1784: 	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1785: 	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1786: 	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1787: 	very first house, of the first and second cause:
1788: 	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1789: 	hai!
1790: 
1791: BENVOLIO	The what?
1792: 
1793: MERCUTIO	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1794: 	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1795: 	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1796: 	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1797: 	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1798: 	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1799: 	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1800: 	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1801: 	bones, their bones!
1802: 
1803: 	[Enter ROMEO]
1804: 
1805: BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1806: 
1807: MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1808: 	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1809: 	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1810: 	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1811: 	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1812: 	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1813: 	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1814: 	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1815: 	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1816: 	fairly last night.
1817: 
1818: ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1819: 
1820: MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1821: 
1822: ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1823: 	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1824: 
1825: MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1826: 	constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1827: 
1828: ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.
1829: 
1830: MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1831: 
1832: ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
1833: 
1834: MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1835: 
1836: ROMEO	Pink for flower.
1837: 
1838: MERCUTIO	Right.
1839: 
1840: ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1841: 
1842: MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1843: 	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1844: 	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1845: 
1846: ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1847: 	singleness.
1848: 
1849: MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1850: 
1851: ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1852: 
1853: MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1854: 	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1855: 	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1856: 	was I with you there for the goose?
1857: 
1858: ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1859: 	not there for the goose.
1860: 
1861: MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1862: 
1863: ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
1864: 
1865: MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1866: 	sharp sauce.
1867: 
1868: ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1869: 
1870: MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1871: 	inch narrow to an ell broad!
1872: 
1873: ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1874: 	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1875: 
1876: MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1877: 	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1878: 	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1879: 	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1880: 	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1881: 
1882: BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
1883: 
1884: MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1885: 
1886: BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1887: 
1888: MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1889: 	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1890: 	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1891: 
1892: ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
1893: 
1894: 	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
1895: 
1896: MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
1897: 
1898: BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1899: 
1900: Nurse	Peter!
1901: 
1902: PETER	Anon!
1903: 
1904: Nurse	My fan, Peter.
1905: 
1906: MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1907: 	fairer face.
1908: 
1909: Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1910: 
1911: MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1912: 
1913: Nurse	Is it good den?
1914: 
1915: MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1916: 	dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1917: 
1918: Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!
1919: 
1920: ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1921: 	mar.
1922: 
1923: Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1924: 	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1925: 	may find the young Romeo?
1926: 
1927: ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1928: 	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1929: 	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1930: 
1931: Nurse	You say well.
1932: 
1933: MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1934: 	wisely, wisely.
1935: 
1936: Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1937: 	you.
1938: 
1939: BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
1940: 
1941: MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1942: 
1943: ROMEO	What hast thou found?
1944: 
1945: MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1946: 	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1947: 
1948: 	[Sings]
1949: 
1950: 	An old hare hoar,
1951: 	And an old hare hoar,
1952: 	Is very good meat in lent
1953: 	But a hare that is hoar
1954: 	Is too much for a score,
1955: 	When it hoars ere it be spent.
1956: 	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1957: 	to dinner, thither.
1958: 
1959: ROMEO	I will follow you.
1960: 
1961: MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1962: 
1963: 	[Singing]
1964: 
1965: 	'lady, lady, lady.'
1966: 
1967: 	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
1968: 
1969: Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1970: 	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1971: 
1972: ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1973: 	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1974: 	to in a month.
1975: 
1976: Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1977: 	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1978: 	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1979: 	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1980: 	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1981: 	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1982: 
1983: PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1984: 	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1985: 	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1986: 	good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1987: 
1988: Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1989: 	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1990: 	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1991: 	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1992: 	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1993: 	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1994: 	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1995: 	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1996: 	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1997: 	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1998: 
1999: ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
2000: 	protest unto thee--
2001: 
2002: Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
2003: 	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2004: 
2005: ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
2006: 
2007: Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
2008: 	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2009: 
2010: ROMEO	Bid her devise
2011: 	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2012: 	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2013: 	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2014: 
2015: Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.
2016: 
2017: ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.
2018: 
2019: Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
2020: 
2021: ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
2022: 	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2023: 	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2024: 	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2025: 	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2026: 	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2027: 	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
2028: 
2029: Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2030: 
2031: ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2032: 
2033: Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2034: 	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2035: 
2036: ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2037: 
2038: NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
2039: 	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
2040: 	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
2041: 	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
2042: 	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
2043: 	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
2044: 	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
2045: 	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
2046: 	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
2047: 
2048: ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
2049: 
2050: Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
2051: 	the--No; I know it begins with some other
2052: 	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
2053: 	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
2054: 	to hear it.
2055: 
2056: ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
2057: 
2058: Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.
2059: 
2060: 	[Exit Romeo]
2061: 	Peter!
2062: 
2063: PETER	Anon!
2064:

2081: 
2082: 	[Enter JULIET]
2083: 
2084: JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2085: 	In half an hour she promised to return.
2086: 	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
2087: 	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
2088: 	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2089: 	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
2090: 	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2091: 	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2092: 	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2093: 	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2094: 	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2095: 	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2096: 	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2097: 	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2098: 	And his to me:
2099: 	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2100: 	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2101: 	O God, she comes!
2102: 
2103: 	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
2104: 
2105: 	O honey nurse, what news?
2106: 	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2107: 
2108: Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.
2109: 
2110: 	[Exit PETER]
2111: 
2112: JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2113: 	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2114: 	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2115: 	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2116: 
2117: Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
2118: 	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
2119: 
2120: JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2121: 	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
2122: 
2123: Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2124: 	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2125: 
2126: JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2127: 	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2128: 	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2129: 	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2130: 	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
2131: 	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2132: 	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2133: 
2134: Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
2135: 	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
2136: 	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
2137: 	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
2138: 	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
2139: 	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
2140: 	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2141: 	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
2142: 
2143: JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
2144: 	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
2145: 
2146: Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2147: 	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2148: 	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
2149: 	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
2150: 	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
2151: 
2152: JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2153: 	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2154: 
2155: Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2156: 	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2157: 	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
2158: 
2159: JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
2160: 	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2161: 	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2162: 	Where is your mother?'
2163: 
2164: Nurse	O God's lady dear!
2165: 	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
2166: 	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2167: 	Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2168: 
2169: JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
2170: 
2171: Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2172: 
2173: JULIET	I have.
2174: 
2175: Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2176: 	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2177: 	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2178: 	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2179: 	Hie you to church; I must another way,
2180: 	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2181: 	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2182: 	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2183: 	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2184: 	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
2185: 
2186: JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

2204: 
2205: FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2206: 	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
2207: 
2208: ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
2209: 	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2210: 	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2211: 	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2212: 	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
2213: 	It is enough I may but call her mine.
2214: 
2215: FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
2216: 	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2217: 	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
2218: 	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2219: 	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2220: 	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
2221: 	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2222: 
2223: 	[Enter JULIET]
2224: 
2225: 	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
2226: 	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
2227: 	A lover may bestride the gossamer
2228: 	That idles in the wanton summer air,
2229: 	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2230: 
2231: JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2232: 
2233: FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2234: 
2235: JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2236: 
2237: ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2238: 	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2239: 	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2240: 	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2241: 	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2242: 	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2243: 
2244: JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2245: 	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2246: 	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2247: 	But my true love is grown to such excess
2248: 	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2249: 
2250: FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2251: 	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone

2269: 	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]
2270: 
2271: BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2272: 	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2273: 	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2274: 	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2275: 
2276: MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2277: 	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2278: 	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2279: 	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2280: 	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2281: 
2282: BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?
2283: 
2284: MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2285: 	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2286: 	soon moody to be moved.
2287: 
2288: BENVOLIO	And what to?
2289: 
2290: MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2291: 	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2292: 	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2293: 	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2294: 	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2295: 	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2296: 	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2297: 	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2298: 	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2299: 	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2300: 	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2301: 	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2302: 	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2303: 	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2304: 	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2305: 	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2306: 
2307: BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2308: 	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2309: 
2310: MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!

2319: 	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2320: 
2321: MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2322: 	something; make it a word and a blow.
2323: 
2324: TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2325: 	will give me occasion.
2326: 
2327: MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2328: 
2329: TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2330: 
2331: MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2332: 	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2333: 	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2334: 	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2335: 
2336: BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2337: 	Either withdraw unto some private place,
2338: 	And reason coldly of your grievances,
2339: 	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2340: 
2341: MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2342: 	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2343: 
2344: 	[Enter ROMEO]
2345: 
2346: TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2347: 
2348: MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2349: 	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2350: 	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2351: 
2352: TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2353: 	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2354: 
2355: ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2356: 	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2357: 	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2358: 	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2359: 
2360: TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2361: 	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2362: 
2363: ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
2364: 	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2365: 	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2366: 	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2367: 	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2368: 
2369: MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2370: 	Alla stoccata carries it away.
2371: 
2372: 	[Draws]
2373: 
2374: 	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2375: 
2376: TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?
2377: 
2378: MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2379: 	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2380: 	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2381: 	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2382: 	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2383: 	ears ere it be out.
2384: 
2385: TYBALT	I am for you.
2386: 
2387: 	[Drawing]
2388: 
2389: ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2390: 
2391: MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.
2392: 
2393: 	[They fight]
2394: 
2395: ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2396: 	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2397: 	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2398: 	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2399: 	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2400: 
2401: 	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies
2402: 	with his followers]
2403: 
2404: MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
2405: 	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2406: 	Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2407: 
2408: BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?
2409: 
2410: MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2411: 	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2412: 
2413: 	[Exit Page]
2414: 
2415: ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2416: 
2417: MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2418: 	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2419: 	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2420: 	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2421: 	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2422: 	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2423: 	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2424: 	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2425: 	was hurt under your arm.
2426: 
2427: ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
2428: 
2429: MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2430: 	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2431: 	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2432: 	And soundly too: your houses!

2434: 	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
2435: 
2436: ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,

2438: 	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2439: 	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2440: 	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2441: 	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2442: 	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2443: 
2444: 	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]
2445: 
2446: BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2447: 	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2448: 	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2449: 
2450: ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2451: 	This but begins the woe, others must end.
2452: 
2453: BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2454: 
2455: ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2456: 	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2457: 	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2458: 
2459: 	[Re-enter TYBALT]
2460: 
2461: 	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2462: 	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2463: 	Is but a little way above our heads,
2464: 	Staying for thine to keep him company:
2465: 	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2466: 
2467: TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2468: 	Shalt with him hence.
2469: 
2470: ROMEO	This shall determine that.
2471: 
2472: 	[They fight; TYBALT falls]
2473: 
2474: BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!
2475: 	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2476: 	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2477: 	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2478: 
2479: ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!
2480: 
2481: BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?
2482: 
2483: 	[Exit ROMEO]
2484: 
2485: 	[Enter Citizens, &c]
2486: 
2487: First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2488: 	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2489: 
2490: BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.
2491: 
2492: First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;
2493: 	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2494: 
2495: 	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their
2496: 	Wives, and others]
2497: 
2498: PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2499: 
2500: BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all
2501: 	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2502: 	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2503: 	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2504: 
2505: LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2506: 	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2507: 	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2508: 	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2509: 	O cousin, cousin!
2510: 
2511: PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2512: 
2513: BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2514: 	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2515: 	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2516: 	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2517: 	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2518: 	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2519: 	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2520: 	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2521: 	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2522: 	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2523: 	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2524: 	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2525: 	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2526: 	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2527: 	his tongue,
2528: 	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2529: 	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2530: 	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2531: 	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2532: 	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2533: 	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2534: 	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2535: 	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2536: 	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2537: 	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2538: 
2539: LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2540: 	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2541: 	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2542: 	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2543: 	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2544: 	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2545: 
2546: PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2547: 	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2548: 
2549: MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2550: 	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2551: 	The life of Tybalt.
2552: 
2553: PRINCE	And for that offence
2554: 	Immediately we do exile him hence:
2555: 	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2556: 	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2557: 	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2558: 	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2559: 	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2560: 	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2561: 	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2562: 	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2563: 	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2564: 	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2565:

2575: 
2576: 
2577: 
2578: SCENE II	Capulet's orchard.
2579: 
2580: 
2581: 	[Enter JULIET]
2582: 
2583: JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2584: 	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2585: 	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2586: 	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2587: 	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2588: 	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2589: 	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2590: 	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2591: 	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2592: 	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2593: 	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2594: 	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2595: 	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2596: 	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2597: 	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2598: 	Think true love acted simple modesty.
2599: 	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2600: 	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2601: 	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2602: 	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2603: 	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2604: 	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2605: 	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2606: 	That all the world will be in love with night
2607: 	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2608: 	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2609: 	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2610: 	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2611: 	As is the night before some festival
2612: 	To an impatient child that hath new robes
2613: 	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2614: 	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2615: 	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2616: 
2617: 	[Enter Nurse, with cords]
2618: 
2619: 	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2620: 	That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2621: 
2622: Nurse	Ay, ay, the cords.
2623: 
2624: 	[Throws them down]
2625: 
2626: JULIET	Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2627: 
2628: Nurse	Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2629: 	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2630: 	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2631: 
2632: JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?
2633: 
2634: Nurse	Romeo can,
2635: 	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2636: 	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2637: 
2638: JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2639: 	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2640: 	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2641: 	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2642: 	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2643: 	I am not I, if there be such an I;
2644: 	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2645: 	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2646: 	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2647: 
2648: Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2649: 	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2650: 	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2651: 	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2652: 	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2653: 
2654: JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2655: 	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2656: 	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2657: 	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2658: 
2659: Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2660: 	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2661: 	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2662: 
2663: JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2664: 	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2665: 	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2666: 	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2667: 	For who is living, if those two are gone?
2668: 
2669: Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2670: 	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2671: 
2672: JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2673: 
2674: Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2675: 
2676: JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2677: 	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2678: 	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2679: 	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2680: 	Despised substance of divinest show!
2681: 	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2682: 	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2683: 	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2684: 	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2685: 	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2686: 	Was ever book containing such vile matter
2687: 	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2688: 	In such a gorgeous palace!
2689: 
2690: Nurse	There's no trust,
2691: 	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2692: 	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2693: 	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2694: 	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2695: 	Shame come to Romeo!
2696: 
2697: JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
2698: 	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2699: 	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2700: 	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2701: 	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2702: 	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2703: 
2704: Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2705: 
2706: JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2707: 	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2708: 	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2709: 	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2710: 	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2711: 	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2712: 	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2713: 	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2714: 	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2715: 	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2716: 	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2717: 	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2718: 	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2719: 	But, O, it presses to my memory,
2720: 	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2721: 	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2722: 	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2723: 	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2724: 	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2725: 	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2726: 	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2727: 	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2728: 	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2729: 	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2730: 	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2731: 	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2732: 	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2733: 	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2734: 	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2735: 	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2736: 	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2737: 
2738: Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2739: 	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2740: 
2741: JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2742: 	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2743: 	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2744: 	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2745: 	He made you for a highway to my bed;
2746: 	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2747: 	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2748: 	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2749: 
2750: Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2751: 	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2752: 	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2753: 	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2754: 
2755: JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2756: 	And bid him come to take his last farewell.

2771: 
2772: 
2773: 	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
2774: 
2775: FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2776: 	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2777: 	And thou art wedded to calamity.
2778: 
2779: 	[Enter ROMEO]
2780: 
2781: ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2782: 	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2783: 	That I yet know not?
2784: 
2785: FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
2786: 	Is my dear son with such sour company:
2787: 	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2788: 
2789: ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2790: 
2791: FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2792: 	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2793: 
2794: ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2795: 	For exile hath more terror in his look,
2796: 	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2797: 
2798: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2799: 	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2800: 
2801: ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
2802: 	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2803: 	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2804: 	And world's exile is death: then banished,
2805: 	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2806: 	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2807: 	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2808: 
2809: FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2810: 	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2811: 	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2812: 	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2813: 	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2814: 
2815: ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2816: 	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2817: 	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2818: 	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2819: 	But Romeo may not: more validity,
2820: 	More honourable state, more courtship lives
2821: 	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2822: 	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2823: 	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2824: 	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2825: 	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2826: 	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2827: 	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2828: 	They are free men, but I am banished.
2829: 	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2830: 	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2831: 	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2832: 	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2833: 	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2834: 	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2835: 	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2836: 	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2837: 	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2838: 
2839: FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2840: 
2841: ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2842: 
2843: FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2844: 	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2845: 	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2846: 
2847: ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2848: 	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2849: 	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2850: 	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2851: 
2852: FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2853: 
2854: ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2855: 
2856: FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2857: 
2858: ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2859: 	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2860: 	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2861: 	Doting like me and like me banished,
2862: 	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2863: 	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2864: 	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2865: 
2866: 	[Knocking within]
2867: 
2868: FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2869: 
2870: ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2871: 	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2872: 
2873: 	[Knocking]
2874: 
2875: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2876: 	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2877: 
2878: 	[Knocking]
2879: 
2880: 	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2881: 	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2882: 
2883: 	[Knocking]
2884: 
2885: 	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2886: 
2887: Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
2888: 	my errand;
2889: 	I come from Lady Juliet.
2890: 
2891: FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
2892: 
2893: 	[Enter Nurse]
2894: 
2895: Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2896: 	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2897: 
2898: FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2899: 
2900: Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2901: 	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2902: 	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2903: 	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2904: 	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2905: 	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2906: 	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2907: 
2908: ROMEO	Nurse!
2909: 
2910: Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2911: 
2912: ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2913: 	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2914: 	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2915: 	With blood removed but little from her own?
2916: 	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2917: 	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2918: 
2919: Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2920: 	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2921: 	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2922: 	And then down falls again.
2923: 
2924: ROMEO	As if that name,
2925: 	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2926: 	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2927: 	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2928: 	In what vile part of this anatomy
2929: 	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2930: 	The hateful mansion.
2931: 
2932: 	[Drawing his sword]
2933: 
2934: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
2935: 	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2936: 	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2937: 	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2938: 	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2939: 	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2940: 	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2941: 	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2942: 	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2943: 	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2944: 	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2945: 	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2946: 	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2947: 	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2948: 	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2949: 	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2950: 	And usest none in that true use indeed
2951: 	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2952: 	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2953: 	Digressing from the valour of a man;
2954: 	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2955: 	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2956: 	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2957: 	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2958: 	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2959: 	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2960: 	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2961: 	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2962: 	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2963: 	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2964: 	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2965: 	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2966: 	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2967: 	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2968: 	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2969: 	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2970: 	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2971: 	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2972: 	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2973: 	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2974: 	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2975: 	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2976: 	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2977: 	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2978: 	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2979: 	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2980: 	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2981: 	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2982: 	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2983: 	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2984: 	Romeo is coming.
2985: 
2986: Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2987: 	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2988: 	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2989: 
2990: ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2991: 
2992: Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2993: 	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2994: 
2995: 	[Exit]
2996: 
2997: ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!
2998: 
2999: FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
3000: 	Either be gone before the watch be set,
3001: 	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
3002: 	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3003: 	And he shall signify from time to time
3004: 	Every good hap to you that chances here:
3005: 	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
3006: 
3007: ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3008: 	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

3025: 	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]
3026: 
3027: CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
3028: 	That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3029: 	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3030: 	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
3031: 	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
3032: 	I promise you, but for your company,
3033: 	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
3034: 
3035: PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
3036: 	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
3037: 
3038: LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
3039: 	To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
3040: 
3041: CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3042: 	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
3043: 	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
3044: 	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
3045: 	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
3046: 	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
3047: 	But, soft! what day is this?
3048: 
3049: PARIS	Monday, my lord,
3050: 
3051: CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
3052: 	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
3053: 	She shall be married to this noble earl.
3054: 	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
3055: 	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3056: 	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3057: 	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3058: 	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
3059: 	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3060: 	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
3061: 
3062: PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
3063: 
3064: CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
3065: 	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
3066: 	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
3067: 	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
3068: 	Afore me! it is so very very late,
3069: 	That we may call it early by and by.

3083: 
3084: SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.
3085: 
3086: 
3087: 	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]
3088: 
3089: JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
3090: 	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3091: 	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
3092: 	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
3093: 	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3094: 
3095: ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3096: 	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
3097: 	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
3098: 	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3099: 	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
3100: 	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3101: 
3102: JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
3103: 	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
3104: 	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
3105: 	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
3106: 	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
3107: 
3108: ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
3109: 	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3110: 	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
3111: 	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
3112: 	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
3113: 	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
3114: 	I have more care to stay than will to go:
3115: 	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
3116: 	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
3117: 
3118: JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
3119: 	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3120: 	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3121: 	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3122: 	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3123: 	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
3124: 	O, now I would they had changed voices too!
3125: 	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3126: 	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
3127: 	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
3128: 
3129: ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
3130: 
3131: 	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]
3132: 
3133: Nurse	Madam!
3134: 
3135: JULIET	Nurse?
3136: 
3137: Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
3138: 	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
3139: 
3140: 	[Exit]
3141: 
3142: JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3143: 
3144: ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
3145: 
3146: 	[He goeth down]
3147: 
3148: JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
3149: 	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
3150: 	For in a minute there are many days:
3151: 	O, by this count I shall be much in years
3152: 	Ere I again behold my Romeo!
3153: 
3154: ROMEO	Farewell!
3155: 	I will omit no opportunity
3156: 	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3157: 
3158: JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3159: 
3160: ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3161: 	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
3162: 
3163: JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
3164: 	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
3165: 	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
3166: 	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
3167: 
3168: ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
3169: 	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
3170: 
3171: 	[Exit]
3172: 
3173: JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
3174: 	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
3175: 	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
3176: 	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
3177: 	But send him back.
3178: 
3179: LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?
3180: 
3181: JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
3182: 	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
3183: 	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
3184: 
3185: 	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
3186: 
3187: LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!
3188: 
3189: JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
3190: 
3191: LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3192: 	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3193: 	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
3194: 	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
3195: 	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3196: 
3197: JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3198: 
3199: LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3200: 	Which you weep for.
3201: 
3202: JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
3203: 	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3204: 
3205: LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
3206: 	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
3207: 
3208: JULIET	What villain madam?
3209: 
3210: LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.
3211: 
3212: JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3213: 	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
3214: 	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3215: 
3216: LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
3217: 
3218: JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
3219: 	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3220: 
3221: LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
3222: 	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
3223: 	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
3224: 	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
3225: 	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
3226: 	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
3227: 
3228: JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
3229: 	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
3230: 	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
3231: 	Madam, if you could find out but a man
3232: 	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
3233: 	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3234: 	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
3235: 	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
3236: 	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
3237: 	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
3238: 
3239: LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3240: 	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3241: 
3242: JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
3243: 	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
3244: 
3245: LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
3246: 	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3247: 	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
3248: 	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
3249: 
3250: JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
3251: 
3252: LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
3253: 	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
3254: 	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
3255: 	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3256: 
3257: JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
3258: 	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
3259: 	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
3260: 	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
3261: 	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3262: 	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
3263: 	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3264: 	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
3265: 
3266: LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
3267: 	And see how he will take it at your hands.
3268: 
3269: 	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]
3270: 
3271: CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
3272: 	But for the sunset of my brother's son
3273: 	It rains downright.
3274: 	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
3275: 	Evermore showering? In one little body
3276: 	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
3277: 	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3278: 	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3279: 	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
3280: 	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
3281: 	Without a sudden calm, will overset
3282: 	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
3283: 	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
3284: 
3285: LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3286: 	I would the fool were married to her grave!
3287: 
3288: CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3289: 	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
3290: 	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
3291: 	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3292: 	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
3293: 
3294: JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
3295: 	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
3296: 	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
3297: 
3298: CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
3299: 	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
3300: 	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
3301: 	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
3302: 	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
3303: 	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3304: 	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3305: 	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
3306: 	You tallow-face!
3307: 
3308: LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
3309: 
3310: JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3311: 	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3312: 
3313: CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
3314: 	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3315: 	Or never after look me in the face:
3316: 	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3317: 	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
3318: 	That God had lent us but this only child;
3319: 	But now I see this one is one too much,
3320: 	And that we have a curse in having her:
3321: 	Out on her, hilding!
3322: 
3323: Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
3324: 	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3325: 
3326: CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3327: 	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3328: 
3329: Nurse	I speak no treason.
3330: 
3331: CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.
3332: 
3333: Nurse	May not one speak?
3334: 
3335: CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!
3336: 	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
3337: 	For here we need it not.
3338: 
3339: LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.
3340: 
3341: CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
3342: 	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3343: 	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3344: 	To have her match'd: and having now provided
3345: 	A gentleman of noble parentage,
3346: 	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3347: 	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3348: 	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
3349: 	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3350: 	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3351: 	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
3352: 	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
3353: 	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3354: 	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
3355: 	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3356: 	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3357: 	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3358: 	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
3359: 	the streets,
3360: 	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3361: 	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3362: 	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
3363: 
3364: 	[Exit]
3365: 
3366: JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3367: 	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3368: 	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3369: 	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3370: 	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3371: 	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3372: 
3373: LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
3374: 	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3375: 
3376: 	[Exit]
3377: 
3378: JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3379: 	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3380: 	How shall that faith return again to earth,
3381: 	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3382: 	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
3383: 	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3384: 	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
3385: 	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
3386: 	Some comfort, nurse.
3387: 
3388: Nurse	Faith, here it is.
3389: 	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
3390: 	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3391: 	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3392: 	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3393: 	I think it best you married with the county.
3394: 	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3395: 	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
3396: 	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3397: 	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3398: 	I think you are happy in this second match,
3399: 	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3400: 	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3401: 	As living here and you no use of him.
3402: 
3403: JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
3404: 
3405: Nurse	And from my soul too;
3406: 	Or else beshrew them both.
3407: 
3408: JULIET	Amen!
3409: 
3410: Nurse	What?
3411: 
3412: JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3413: 	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3414: 	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3415: 	To make confession and to be absolved.
3416: 
3417: Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3418: 
3419: 	[Exit]
3420: 
3421: JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3422: 	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3423: 	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3424: 	Which she hath praised him with above compare
3425: 	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3426: 	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3427: 	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3428: 	If all else fail, myself have power to die.

3443: 
3444: 
3445: 	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]
3446: 
3447: FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3448: 
3449: PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
3450: 	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3451: 
3452: FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3453: 	Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3454: 
3455: PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3456: 	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3457: 	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3458: 	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3459: 	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3460: 	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3461: 	To stop the inundation of her tears;
3462: 	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3463: 	May be put from her by society:
3464: 	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3465: 
3466: FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3467: 	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3468: 
3469: 	[Enter JULIET]
3470: 
3471: PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3472: 
3473: JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3474: 
3475: PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3476: 
3477: JULIET	What must be shall be.
3478: 
3479: FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
3480: 
3481: PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?
3482: 
3483: JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
3484: 
3485: PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.
3486: 
3487: JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
3488: 
3489: PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3490: 
3491: JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
3492: 	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3493: 
3494: PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3495: 
3496: JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
3497: 	For it was bad enough before their spite.
3498: 
3499: PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3500: 
3501: JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3502: 	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3503: 
3504: PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3505: 
3506: JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3507: 	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3508: 	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3509: 
3510: FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3511: 	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3512: 
3513: PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
3514: 	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3515: 	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3516: 
3517: 	[Exit]
3518: 
3519: JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3520: 	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3521: 
3522: FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3523: 	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3524: 	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3525: 	On Thursday next be married to this county.
3526: 
3527: JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3528: 	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3529: 	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3530: 	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3531: 	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3532: 	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3533: 	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3534: 	Shall be the label to another deed,
3535: 	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3536: 	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3537: 	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3538: 	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3539: 	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3540: 	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3541: 	Which the commission of thy years and art
3542: 	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3543: 	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3544: 	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3545: 
3546: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3547: 	Which craves as desperate an execution.
3548: 	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3549: 	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3550: 	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3551: 	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3552: 	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3553: 	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3554: 	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3555: 
3556: JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3557: 	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3558: 	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3559: 	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3560: 	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3561: 	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3562: 	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3563: 	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3564: 	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3565: 	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3566: 	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3567: 	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3568: 
3569: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3570: 	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3571: 	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3572: 	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3573: 	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3574: 	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3575: 	When presently through all thy veins shall run
3576: 	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3577: 	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3578: 	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3579: 	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3580: 	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3581: 	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3582: 	Each part, deprived of supple government,
3583: 	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3584: 	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3585: 	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3586: 	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3587: 	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3588: 	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3589: 	Then, as the manner of our country is,
3590: 	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3591: 	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3592: 	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3593: 	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3594: 	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3595: 	And hither shall he come: and he and I
3596: 	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3597: 	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3598: 	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3599: 	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3600: 	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3601: 
3602: JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3603: 
3604: FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3605: 	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3606: 	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3607: 
3608: JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3609: 	Farewell, dear father!

3637: 
3638: CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?
3639: 
3640: Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his

3652:

3664: 	To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd

3666: 	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3667: 	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3668: 
3669: CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:

3671: 
3672: JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3673: 	And gave him what becomed love I might,
3674: 	Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3675: 
3676: CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3677: 	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3678: 	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.

3755: 	[Laying down her dagger]
3756: 
3757: 	What if it be a poison, which the friar
3758: 	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3759: 	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3760: 	Because he married me before to Romeo?
3761: 	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3762: 	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3763: 	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3764: 	I wake before the time that Romeo
3765: 	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3766: 	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3767: 	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3768: 	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3769: 	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3770: 	The horrible conceit of death and night,
3771: 	Together with the terror of the place,--
3772: 	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3773: 	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3774: 	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3775: 	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3776: 	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3777: 	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3778: 	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3779: 	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3780: 	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3781: 	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3782: 	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3783: 	Environed with all these hideous fears?
3784: 	And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3785: 	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3786: 	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,

3858: 	For so he said he would: I hear him near.

3889: 	Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3890: 	Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3891: 	What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3892: 	Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3893: 	The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3894: 	That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3895: 	Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3896: 	I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3897: 	Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3898: 	He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3899: 
3900: 	[Undraws the curtains]
3901: 
3902: 	What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3903: 	I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3904: 	Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3905: 	O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3906: 	Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

3915: 
3916: Nurse	Look, look! O heavy day!
3917: 
3918: LADY CAPULET	O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3919: 	Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3920: 	Help, help! Call help.
3921: 
3922: 	[Enter CAPULET]
3923:

3925:

3927: 
3928: LADY CAPULET	Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3929: 
3930: CAPULET	Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3931: 	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3932: 	Life and these lips have long been separated:
3933: 	Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3934: 	Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3935: 
3936: Nurse	O lamentable day!
3937: 
3938: LADY CAPULET	                  O woful time!
3939: 
3940: CAPULET	Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3941: 	Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3942: 
3943: 	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians]
3944: 
3945: FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3946: 
3947: CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.
3948: 	O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3949: 	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3950: 	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3951: 	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3952: 	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3953: 	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3954: 
3955: PARIS	Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3956: 	And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3957: 
3958: LADY CAPULET	Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3959: 	Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3960: 	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3961: 	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3962: 	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3963: 	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3964: 
3965: Nurse	O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3966: 	Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3967: 	That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3968: 	O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3969: 	Never was seen so black a day as this:
3970: 	O woful day, O woful day!
3971: 
3972: PARIS	Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3973: 	Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3974: 	By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3975: 	O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3976: 
3977: CAPULET	Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3978: 	Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3979: 	To murder, murder our solemnity?
3980: 	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3981: 	Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3982: 	And with my child my joys are buried.
3983: 
3984: FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3985: 	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3986: 	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3987: 	And all the better is it for the maid:
3988: 	Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3989: 	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3990: 	The most you sought was her promotion;
3991: 	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3992: 	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3993: 	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3994: 	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3995: 	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3996: 	She's not well married that lives married long;
3997: 	But she's best married that dies married young.
3998: 	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3999: 	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
4000: 	In all her best array bear her to church:
4001: 	For though fond nature bids us an lament,
4002: 	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4003: 
4004: CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
4005: 	Turn from their office to black funeral;
4006: 	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
4007: 	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
4008: 	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
4009: 	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4010: 	And all things change them to the contrary.
4011: 
4012: FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
4013: 	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
4014: 	To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
4015: 	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;

4030: 
4031: PETER	Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
4032: 	ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
4033: 
4034: First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'
4035: 
4036: PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
4037: 	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
4038: 	to comfort me.
4039: 
4040: First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
4041: 
4042: PETER	You will not, then?
4043: 
4044: First Musician	No.
4045: 
4046: PETER	I will then give it you soundly.
4047: 
4048: First Musician	What will you give us?
4049: 
4050: PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
4051: 	I will give you the minstrel.
4052: 
4053: First Musician	Then I will give you the serving-creature.
4054: 
4055: PETER	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
4056: 	your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
4057: 	I'll fa you; do you note me?
4058: 
4059: First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.
4060: 
4061: Second Musician	Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
4062: 
4063: PETER	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
4064: 	with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
4065: 	me like men:
4066: 	'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
4067: 	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
4068: 	Then music with her silver sound'--
4069: 	why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
4070: 	sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
4071: 
4072: Musician	Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
4073: 
4074: PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
4075: 
4076: Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
4077: 
4078: PETER	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
4079: 
4080: Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.
4081: 
4082: PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
4083: 	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
4084: 	because musicians have no gold for sounding:
4085: 	'Then music with her silver sound
4086: 	With speedy help doth lend redress.'

4113: 	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
4114: 	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
4115: 	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
4116: 	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4117: 	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
4118: 	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
4119: 	to think!--
4120: 	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
4121: 	That I revived, and was an emperor.
4122: 	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
4123: 	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
4124: 
4125: 	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
4126: 
4127: 	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
4128: 	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
4129: 	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4130: 	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
4131: 	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
4132: 
4133: BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
4134: 	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
4135: 	And her immortal part with angels lives.
4136: 	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
4137: 	And presently took post to tell it you:
4138: 	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4139: 	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4140: 
4141: ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
4142: 	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
4143: 	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
4144: 
4145: BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
4146: 	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
4147: 	Some misadventure.
4148: 
4149: ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:
4150: 	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4151: 	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
4152: 
4153: BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.
4154: 
4155: ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,
4156: 	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
4157: 
4158: 	[Exit BALTHASAR]
4159: 
4160: 	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
4161: 	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
4162: 	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
4163: 	I do remember an apothecary,--
4164: 	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
4165: 	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4166: 	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
4167: 	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
4168: 	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4169: 	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
4170: 	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
4171: 	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4172: 	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
4173: 	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
4174: 	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
4175: 	Noting this penury, to myself I said
4176: 	'An if a man did need a poison now,
4177: 	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4178: 	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
4179: 	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
4180: 	And this same needy man must sell it me.
4181: 	As I remember, this should be the house.
4182: 	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
4183: 	What, ho! apothecary!
4184: 
4185: 	[Enter Apothecary]
4186: 
4187: Apothecary	Who calls so loud?
4188: 
4189: ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
4190: 	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
4191: 	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
4192: 	As will disperse itself through all the veins
4193: 	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
4194: 	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
4195: 	As violently as hasty powder fired
4196: 	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4197: 
4198: Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
4199: 	Is death to any he that utters them.
4200: 
4201: ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
4202: 	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
4203: 	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
4204: 	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
4205: 	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
4206: 	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
4207: 	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
4208: 
4209: Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
4210: 
4211: ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
4212: 
4213: Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
4214: 	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
4215: 	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
4216: 
4217: ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
4218: 	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
4219: 	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
4220: 	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4221: 	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
4222: 	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4223: 	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

4254: 	Suspecting that we both were in a house
4255: 	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4256: 	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;

4260:

4262: 	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
4263: 	So fearful were they of infection.
4264: 
4265: FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
4266: 	The letter was not nice but full of charge
4267: 	Of dear import, and the neglecting it

4338: 	Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
4339: 	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
4340: 	And do not interrupt me in my course.
4341: 	Why I descend into this bed of death,
4342: 	Is partly to behold my lady's face;
4343: 	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
4344: 	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
4345: 	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
4346: 	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
4347: 	In what I further shall intend to do,
4348: 	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
4349: 	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
4350: 	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
4351: 	More fierce and more inexorable far
4352: 	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
4353: 
4354: BALTHASAR	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
4355: 
4356: ROMEO	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
4357: 	Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
4358: 
4359: BALTHASAR	[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
4360: 	His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
4361: 
4362: 	[Retires]
4363: 
4364: ROMEO	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
4365: 	Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
4366: 	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
4367: 	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
4368: 
4369: 	[Opens the tomb]
4370: 
4371: PARIS	This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
4372: 	That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
4373: 	It is supposed, the fair creature died;
4374: 	And here is come to do some villanous shame
4375: 	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
4376: 
4377: 	[Comes forward]
4378: 
4379: 	Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
4380: 	Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
4381: 	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
4382: 	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
4383: 
4384: ROMEO	I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
4385: 	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
4386: 	Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
4387: 	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
4388: 	Put not another sin upon my head,
4389: 	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
4390: 	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
4391: 	For I come hither arm'd against myself:
4392: 	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
4393: 	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
4394: 
4395: PARIS	I do defy thy conjurations,
4396: 	And apprehend thee for a felon here.
4397: 
4398: ROMEO	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
4399: 
4400: 	[They fight]
4401: 
4402: PAGE	O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
4403: 
4404: 	[Exit]
4405: 
4406: PARIS	O, I am slain!
4407: 
4408: 	[Falls]
4409: 
4410: 	If thou be merciful,
4411: 	Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
4412: 
4413: 	[Dies]
4414: 
4415: ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
4416: 	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
4417: 	What said my man, when my betossed soul
4418: 	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4419: 	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
4420: 	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
4421: 	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4422: 	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
4423: 	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4424: 	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
4425: 	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
4426: 	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4427: 	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
4428: 	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
4429: 
4430: 	[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
4431: 
4432: 	How oft when men are at the point of death
4433: 	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
4434: 	A lightning before death: O, how may I
4435: 	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
4436: 	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
4437: 	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
4438: 	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
4439: 	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4440: 	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
4441: 	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4442: 	O, what more favour can I do to thee,
4443: 	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4444: 	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4445: 	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
4446: 	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
4447: 	That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4448: 	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4449: 	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4450: 	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
4451: 	And never from this palace of dim night
4452: 	Depart again: here, here will I remain
4453: 	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
4454: 	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
4455: 	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4456: 	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
4457: 	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4458: 	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4459: 	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
4460: 	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4461: 	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4462: 	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4463: 	Here's to my love!
4464: 
4465: 	[Drinks]
4466: 
4467: 	O true apothecary!
4468: 	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4469: 
4470: 	[Dies]
4471: 
4472: 	[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR
4473: 	LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
4474: 
4475: FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4476: 	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
4477: 
4478: BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4479: 
4480: FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4481: 	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
4482: 	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4483: 	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
4484: 
4485: BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4486: 	One that you love.
4487: 
4488: FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?
4489: 
4490: BALTHASAR	Romeo.
4491: 
4492: FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?
4493: 
4494: BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.
4495: 
4496: FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.
4497: 
4498: BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
4499: 	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4500: 	And fearfully did menace me with death,
4501: 	If I did stay to look on his intents.
4502: 
4503: FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
4504: 	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4505: 
4506: BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
4507: 	I dreamt my master and another fought,
4508: 	And that my master slew him.
4509: 
4510: FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
4511: 
4512: 	[Advances]
4513: 
4514: 	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
4515: 	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
4516: 	What mean these masterless and gory swords
4517: 	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4518: 
4519: 	[Enters the tomb]
4520: 
4521: 	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
4522: 	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4523: 	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4524: 	The lady stirs.
4525: 
4526: 	[JULIET wakes]
4527: 
4528: JULIET	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
4529: 	I do remember well where I should be,
4530: 	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4531: 
4532: 	[Noise within]
4533: 
4534: FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
4535: 	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4536: 	A greater power than we can contradict
4537: 	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4538: 	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4539: 	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4540: 	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4541: 	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
4542: 	Come, go, good Juliet,
4543: 
4544: 	[Noise again]
4545: 
4546: 		 I dare no longer stay.
4547: 
4548: JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4549: 
4550: 	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
4551: 
4552: 	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4553: 	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
4554: 	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4555: 	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
4556: 	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4557: 	To make die with a restorative.
4558: 
4559: 	[Kisses him]
4560: 
4561: 	Thy lips are warm.
4562: 
4563: First Watchman	[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?
4564: 
4565: JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
4566: 
4567: 	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
4568: 
4569: 	This is thy sheath;
4570: 
4571: 	[Stabs herself]
4572: 
4573: 	there rust, and let me die.
4574: 
4575: 	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]
4576: 
4577: 	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]
4578: 
4579: PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
4580: 
4581: First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
4582: 	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
4583: 	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
4584: 	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4585: 	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
4586: 	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
4587: 	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
4588: 	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
4589: 	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4590: 	We cannot without circumstance descry.
4591: 
4592: 	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]
4593: 
4594: Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
4595: 
4596: First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
4597: 
4598: 	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]
4599: 
4600: Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
4601: 	We took this mattock and this spade from him,
4602: 	As he was coming from this churchyard side.
4603: 
4604: First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4605: 
4606: 	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]
4607: 
4608: PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,
4609: 	That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4610: 
4611: 	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]
4612: 
4613: CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4614: 
4615: LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,
4616: 	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4617: 	With open outcry toward our monument.
4618: 
4619: PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4620: 
4621: First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4622: 	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4623: 	Warm and new kill'd.
4624: 
4625: PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4626: 
4627: First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4628: 	With instruments upon them, fit to open
4629: 	These dead men's tombs.
4630: 
4631: CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4632: 	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4633: 	Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4634: 	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4635: 
4636: LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4637: 	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4638: 
4639: 	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]
4640: 
4641: PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4642: 	To see thy son and heir more early down.
4643: 
4644: MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4645: 	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4646: 	What further woe conspires against mine age?
4647: 
4648: PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.
4649: 
4650: MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4651: 	To press before thy father to a grave?
4652: 
4653: PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4654: 	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4655: 	And know their spring, their head, their
4656: 	true descent;
4657: 	And then will I be general of your woes,
4658: 	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4659: 	And let mischance be slave to patience.
4660: 	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4661: 
4662: FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
4663: 	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4664: 	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4665: 	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4666: 	Myself condemned and myself excused.
4667: 
4668: PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4669: 
4670: FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4671: 	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4672: 	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4673: 	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4674: 	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4675: 	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4676: 	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4677: 	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4678: 	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4679: 	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4680: 	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4681: 	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4682: 	To rid her from this second marriage,
4683: 	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4684: 	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4685: 	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4686: 	As I intended, for it wrought on her
4687: 	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4688: 	That he should hither come as this dire night,
4689: 	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4690: 	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4691: 	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4692: 	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4693: 	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4694: 	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4695: 	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4696: 	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4697: 	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4698: 	But when I came, some minute ere the time
4699: 	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4700: 	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4701: 	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4702: 	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4703: 	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4704: 	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4705: 	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4706: 	All this I know; and to the marriage
4707: 	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4708: 	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4709: 	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4710: 	Unto the rigour of severest law.
4711: 
4712: PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
4713: 	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4714: 
4715: BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4716: 	And then in post he came from Mantua
4717: 	To this same place, to this same monument.
4718: 	This letter he early bid me give his father,
4719: 	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4720: 	I departed not and left him there.
4721: 
4722: PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4723: 	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4724: 	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4725: 
4726: PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4727: 	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4728: 	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4729: 	And by and by my master drew on him;
4730: 	And then I ran away to call the watch.
4731: 
4732: PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4733: 	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4734: 	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4735: 	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4736: 	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4737: 	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4738: 	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4739: 	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4740: 	And I for winking at your discords too
4741: 	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4742: 
4743: CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4744: 	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4745: 	Can I demand.
4746: 
4747: MONTAGUE   But I can give thee more:
4748: 	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4749: 	That while Verona by that name is known,
4750: 	There shall no figure at such rate be set
4751: 	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4752: 
4753: CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4754: 	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4755: 
4756: PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4757: 	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4758: 	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4759: 	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4760: 	For never was a story of more woe
4761: 	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4762: 
4763: 	[Exeunt]
